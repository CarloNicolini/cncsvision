1) Download Boost from http://www.boost.org/users/download/
2) Unzip the folder in your C:\ directory
3) Open VS Command MS Window as Administrator
4) Change your folder position so that you are in the unzipped folder
5) Run bootstrap.bat (you found it in the root folder)
6) Run b2 --build-type=complete --build-dir=C:\Boost\bin toolset=msvc 
7) Wait until it finish to compile (this process takes some time, if it takes few seconds something went wrong!)
8)At the end, if you've got no errors, the prompt will show you the path you need to add to the System Path.
  If you're not getting errors and the prompt doesn't give you any path check the following path:
  C:\yourunzippedfolder\stage\lib\ --> here you should find the .dll and .lib files
  C:\yourunzippedfolder\
  These are the paths you should add. If you have no stage folder, check in the C:\ folder if it has been created the Boost folder. 
  This folder must contain the folder bin.v2, which contains all the builds for all the libraries.
  If you don't have these folders, you should try again to build the libraries (from step 5).
